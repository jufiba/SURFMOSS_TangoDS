# SURFMOSS_TangoDS
This are various Device Servers for the Tango Control system to interface with hardware we have in our laboratory. A lot of it is connected by RS232 serial ports through USB converters, and also quite a few are connected to Arduinos. The quality varies a lot. As we are a small lab, we have not worried too much about complete error checking, if something dies usually we drop by and restart the software. Also, most of it is written in Python, using the tango Python HL interface for device servers, and using Pogo.
