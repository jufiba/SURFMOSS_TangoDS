PyAlarm Startup Modes
=====================

The PyAlarm Startup is controlled by **StartupDelay** and **Enabled** properties.

**StartupDelay** will put the PyAlarm in *PAUSED* state after a restart; 
to not start to evaluate formulas immediately but after some seconds, 
thus giving time to other devices to start.

The **Enabled** property will instead control the notification actions:

- If *False*, no notification will be triggered. 
- If *True*, all notifications can be sent once **StartupDelay** has passed.
- If a *Number* is given, all notifications triggered between startup and ``t+Enabled`` will be ignored. 
- ``Enabled>(AlarmThreshold*PollingPeriod)``: "*Silent restart*", activates the Alarms that were presumably active before a restart; but do not retriggers the notifications.

``Enabled = 120`` is the typical case; not triggering notifications until the device has been running for at least 3 minutes.

If ``Enabled = False`` or while ``t < Start+Enabled`` the PyAlarm State will be **DISABLED**.
